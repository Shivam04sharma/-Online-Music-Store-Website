        <h1> About Rock music </h1> <br>
        <h4> Introduction and history </h4> <br>
        <p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
            developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom.
            It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and 
            blues genres of African-American music and from country music.Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance 
            the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development.
            By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, 
            including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock.
            From the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. 
            Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, 
            including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals in the 2000s. 
            The 2010s saw a slow decline in rock music's mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy, with hip hop surpassing it as the most popular genre in the United States.</p>
        <br>
        <h4> Prominent Rock Artists</h4>
        <p> There have been many Rock artists to rock the world with their own style of music such as :-

        <p><b> <a id = "#Elvis">1. Elvis Presley,"King of Rock and Roll" </a></b> <br>
            Elvis Aaron Presley(January 8, 1935 to August 16, 1977), or simply Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", 
            he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.
            Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, 
            recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues.
            Having sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by Guinness World Records. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm & blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. 
            Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

            <br> <br>
            <h4> Musicianship </h4> <br>
            <p>Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. While he couldn't read or write music and had no formal lessons, he was a natural musician and played everything by ear.[341] Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. 
            Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA albums. He played electric bass guitar on "(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care" after his bassist Bill Black had trouble with the instrument.[342] Presley played the bass line including the intro. Presley played piano on songs such as "Old Shep" and "First in Line" from his 1956 album Elvis.
            He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as From Elvis in Memphis and "Moody Blue", and on "Unchained Melody" which was one of the last songs that he recorded.
            Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called "Are You Lonesome Tonight". In the 68 Comeback Special, Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, 
            playing it on songs such as "Baby What You Want Me to Do" and "One Night". Presley played the back of his guitar on some of his hits such as "All Shook Up", "Don't Be Cruel", and "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear", providing percussion by slapping the instrument to create a beat.[347] The album Elvis is Back! features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as "I Will Be Home Again" and "Like a Baby".

        <p><b><a id="beatles">2. Beatles,"The fab four" </a></b> <br>
            The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.
            Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a "fifth Beatle".
            The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.</p>
            <br> <br>
            <h4> Achievements </h4> 
            <p> 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970).The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards,the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US.In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album.They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.[327]The best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 600 million units as of 2012.[434][nb 11] From 1991 to 2009 The Beatles have sold 57 million albums in United States according to Nielsen Soundscan.[436] They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen,[437] and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act.[438] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years.[439] They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary.[440] As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty.[441] The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 183 million units in the US, more than any other artist.[442] They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.[443] In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[444]On 16 January each year, beginning in 2001, people celebrate World Beatles Day under UNESCO. This date has direct relation to the opening of the Cavern Club in 1957.[445][446] In 2007, the Beatles became the first band to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.</p>
            <h4> Genres </h4>  
            <p>Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of Beatles for Sale, "You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP",while Gould credits Rubber Soul as "the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop.Here's the links to some of their most famous music: -</p> <br> <br>

        <p><b><a id="queen"> 3. Queen </a></b> <br>
            Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. The band comprised Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured as "Queen +", with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250 million to 300 million, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005 they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, and in 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>    
        <br> <br>
        <h4> Achievements </h4>
        <p> In 2001,Queen were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.In 2002,Queen were given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.In 2003,Queen was the first band, rather than just individual, to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

        <h4> Music style and influences </h4>
        <p> Queen drew artistic influence from British rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s, such as the Beatles, the Kinks, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Who, Black Sabbath, Slade, Deep Purple, David Bowie, Genesis and Yes, with Mercury also inspired by the rock and roll singers Little Richard, Elvis Presley and the gospel singer Aretha Franklin.On the Beatles, Brian May stated they "built our bible as far as musical composition, arrangement and production went. The White Album is a complete catalogue of how you should use a studio to build songs."[330] Mercury said, "John Lennon was larger than life, and an absolute genius. Even at a very early stage when they were the Beatles, I always preferred John Lennon's things. I don't know why. He just had that magic."[328] May and Mercury were influenced by Jimi Hendrix, with Mercury saying "he really had everything any rock 'n' roll star should have",[331] and May saying "Jimi is, of course, my number one. And I've always said that [...] I never stop learning from Jimi."[332] Mercury's thesis for his Ealing College degree was on Hendrix, and Mercury and Taylor closed their Kensington Market stall on 18 September 1970 to commemorate his death.[333]At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as "Led Zeppelin meets Yes" due to its combination of "acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics".[334] Although Mercury stated Robert Plant as his favourite singer and Led Zeppelin as "the greatest" rock band, he also said Queen "have more in common with Liza Minnelli than Led Zeppelin. We're more in the showbiz tradition than the rock'n'roll tradition".[328] In his book on Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, Eddie Trunk described Queen as "a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone", as well as observing that the band "sounded British".[335] Rob Halford of Judas Priest commented, "It's rare that you struggle to label a band. If you're a heavy metal band you're meant to look and sound like a heavy metal band but you can't really call Queen anything. They could be a pop band one day or the band that wrote 'Bicycle Race' the next and a full-blown metal band the next. In terms of the depth of the musical landscape that they covered, it was very similar to some extent to the Beatles."[336] While stating they were influenced by various artists and genres, Joe Bosso of Guitar World magazine writes, "Queen seemed to occupy their own lane."Queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.[338] The music styles and genres they have been associated with include progressive rock (also known as symphonic rock),[339] art rock,[46][340] glam rock,[341] arena rock,[339] heavy metal,[339] operatic pop,[339] pop rock,[339] psychedelic rock,[342] baroque pop,[343] and rockabilly.[343] Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by diverse musical styles which are not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera,[344] music hall,[344] folk music,[345] gospel,[346] ragtime,[347] and dance/disco.[348] Their 1980 single "Another One Bites the Dust" became a major hit single in the funk rock genre.[349] Several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions".[350] Similarly, "Radio Ga Ga" became a live favourite because it would have "crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally".Here's the links to some of their most famous music: -</p>
